   # What is miDev?
Introducing miDev, the first reverse job board for Michigan.

miDev is a place where computer experts in Michigan, or people who want to work there, make profiles about themselves. 

Companies can look at these pages and talk to them to see if they want to work together.

It's a way to find great computer experts in Michigan and cool jobs without needing a middle person or paying money upfront.

  Inspired by [jschimp](https://jschimp.com/), [railsdevs](https://railsdevs.com/), and [japan-dev](https://japan-dev.com/).

  Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by [Nick Stambaugh](https://github.com/NicholasStambaugh).
